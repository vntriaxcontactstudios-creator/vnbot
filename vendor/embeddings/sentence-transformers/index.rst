   Sentence Transformers v5.5 recently released, introducing the `train-sentence-transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers/tree/main/skills>`_ Agent Skill. Using an AI coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini CLI, ...)? Install it via ``hf skills add train-sentence-transformers [--global] [--claude]`` and ask your agent to train or finetune an embedding, reranker, or sparse encoder model on your data. See the `v5.5.0 Release Notes <https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers/releases/tag/v5.5.0>`_ for more details.

SentenceTransformers Documentation
==================================

Sentence Transformers (a.k.a. SBERT) is the go-to Python module for using and training state-of-the-art embedding and reranker models.
It can be used to compute embeddings from text, images, audio, or video using Sentence Transformer models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#sentence-transformer>`__), to calculate similarity scores using Cross-Encoder (a.k.a. reranker) models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#cross-encoder>`__), or to generate sparse embeddings using Sparse Encoder models (`quickstart <docs/quickstart.html#sparse-encoder>`__). This unlocks a wide range of applications, including `semantic search <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/semantic-search/README.html>`_, `semantic textual similarity <docs/sentence_transformer/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html>`_, and `paraphrase mining <examples/sentence_transformer/applications/paraphrase-mining/README.html>`_.

A wide selection of over `10,000 pre-trained Sentence Transformers models <https://huggingface.co/models?library=sentence-transformers>`_ are available for immediate use on 🤗 Hugging Face, including many of the state-of-the-art models from the `Massive Text Embeddings Benchmark (MTEB) leaderboard <https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard>`_. Additionally, it is easy to train or finetune your own `embedding models <docs/sentence_transformer/training_overview.html>`_, `reranker models <docs/cross_encoder/training_overview.html>`_, or `sparse encoder models <docs/sparse_encoder/training_overview.html>`_ using Sentence Transformers, enabling you to create custom models for your specific use cases.

Sentence Transformers was created by `UKP Lab <http://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/>`_ and is being maintained by `🤗 Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co>`_. Don't hesitate to open an issue on the `Sentence Transformers repository <https://github.com/huggingface/sentence-transformers>`_ if something is broken or if you have further questions.

Usage
=====

.. seealso::
  
   See the `Quickstart <docs/quickstart.html>`__ for more quick information on how to use Sentence Transformers.

Working with Sentence Transformer models is straightforward:

.. sidebar:: Installation
